# Blockchain for Healthcare

![Overview](/public/screenshots/overview.png)

## Overview

**Blockchain for Healthcare** is a proof-of-concept decentralized application (dApp) designed to revolutionize the healthcare industry, guaranteeing privacy, transparency, and a tamper-proof system for securely managing medical records. Built with React, the dApp provides a user-friendly interface to handle healthcare data with blockchain technology, empowering patients and healthcare providers alike.

## Key Features

- **Patient Record Management**: Create and securely store patient records on the blockchain.
- **Data Fetching**: Retrieve medical records with guaranteed accuracy and immutability.
- **Role-Based Access**: Only authorized healthcare providers can access certain functions, ensuring privacy and secure interactions.
- **Contract Owner Authorization**: The contract owner has the authority to approve healthcare providers, controlling access within the system.

## Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (Ethereum)
- **Frontend**: React
- **Web3 Library**: Ethers.js
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Layer 1 / Layer 2 compatible)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) (or another Ethereum wallet)

### Installation

```bash
1. **Clone the repository**:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-for-healthcare.git
   cd blockchain-for-healthcare

2. **Install dependencies**:

   npm install

3. **Start the development server**:

   npm start
```

### Deploying Smart Contract

The smart contract, written in Solidity, can be found in `[specific_path]`. You can add new features and deploy it yourself using Foundry, Hardhat, Remix, or any tool you find fit.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

```bash
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
REACT_APP_INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key
```

## Usage

```bash
- **Patient Registration**: Authorized healthcare providers can create and store patient records through the app.
- **Data Access**: Patients and providers can securely retrieve medical records, ensuring transparency and data accuracy.
- **Healthcare Provider Authorization**: Only healthcare providers approved by the contract owner can perform certain actions.
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to explore the code, suggest enhancements, or add new features. You can deploy the smart contract yourself using Foundry, Hardhat, Remix, or any suitable tool.

```bash
1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a branch**:

   git checkout -b feature/YourFeature

3. **Commit your changes**:

   git commit -m 'Add YourFeature'

4. **Push to the branch**:

   git push origin feature/YourFeature

5. **Open a Pull Request**
